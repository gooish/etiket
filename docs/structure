- git repo for tickets
    - command "push" to push to repo
        - credential handling?

- local lists (or dicts?) for ticket editing
    - command "save" for saving to files?
    - combined command to save and push (call both commands sequentially)
    - would require state handling inbetween multiple instances

- no git repo??
    - where to save stuff
    - cloud service? would be easiest
    - getting that on servers might be shitty
    - OneDrive with abraunegg for wrapping?

- combined file for all, file for each, or combined list and files for each?
    - would make making a backend shitty, dont wanna do that

- google drive!!
    - requires no netcode, could work as easily locally as remotely
    - shit to run on linux
